# Professional-profile-chart
The professional profile must provide an optimal range score on each personality scale of the test. It should look like a table, where each line is a personality scale. The first column is the scale's name, the second column is graphical representation of the score total range (1 to 10) with the optimal range marked green. I imagine that looking like horizontal boxplots, with whiskers marking the total range, and green boxes - the optimal range. The third column is a short verbal description. Right now, due to technical confinements, I insert the numbers manually. E.g.: pilot's profile optimal scores: Anxiety: 1-3, Achievement striving: 6-10, Boredom intolerance: 1-4, and so on.
